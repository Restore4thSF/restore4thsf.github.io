<p>Bob asked me to share his writeup of the cell phone class:</p>
<p>I sat in on the android phone security break out group. To keep it simple, I&#8217;ll just say a little bit about the apps for secure text and voice. They are both pretty easy to install and use</p>
<p>For text messages go to the App Store and download Text Secure, setup is easy, follow the prompts. Once you have exchanged a key with someone also using it, every text you send them will be encrypted. Easiest way to verify each other is in person of course, it basically sends each person a hash tag, you can do this remotely but always easier and better to do when you are together. Using this app basically overrides your standard text client, any text you send will look for the recipient also using it. If they aren&#8217;t , no biggie. It then is just a standard text. Once set up, it is completely transparent to the user.</p>
<p>Encrypted voice calls:</p>
<p>Download the Red Phone app, simple to set up, again follow the prompts This works a little differently in use, it generates a one time key between the parties based on a 2 word pass phrase. Basically if you call someone also using red phone, you will each see a pass phrase, just say the phrase at the beginning of the call and then you are encrypted Again, pretty easy to use&#8230; Oh, one of the devs was there and I asked him about VoIP and yes, this works on that too. So if you use google voice or Skype, your voice calls will still be encrypted .</p>
<p>Both of these apps are from whisper net and free to use.</p>
<p>Oh, we did talk a bit about encrypting all of your phones data as well. Go to settings/security/encrypt device, follow the prompts. Encrypting all of your phones data will take some time, be sure you are plugged in to your charger</p>
<p>Also discussed password security for your phone, it&#8217;s kind of a balance there&#8230; Sure, a 40 character password is more secure but who wants to type that in every time you want to unlock your phone You should have one but its up to you how hard you want to make it for yourself</p>

<p>PGP Encryption taught by Will.</p>
<p>Download <strong>GPG, Mozilla Thunderbird, and a plugin called Enigmail</strong>. PGP encryption was used by Glenn Greenwald and Snowden. It works with a pair of keys, a private and a public key.</p>
<p>Encryption is done by sequences of numbers, and you and your recipient have to share the same “cypher” for that. Simplest is Rot13, shift all the letters 13 spaces. And then you can change each letter by different increments, which creates much higher level of security. Then there&#8217;s “Asymmetric encryption” &#8211; this is our method, it uses two keys, private and public. <strong>Someone can write you an email that’s encrypted by public key and can only be decrypted with your private key.</strong> If you send an email to four people, it will be encrypted four times using their public keys.</p>
<p>Here are the essential instructions:</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the two applications and the plugin, you will go to the Thunderbird menu, find OpenPGP and select “Key Management” and generate a key with a very secure passcode/password. (There’s a dialogue box regarding revocation certificates, you can do that or wait til later). You will right click on the key in the Key Management window, and upload it to all the listed servers. Then once you exchange keys with another person, when you create an email, you can select encrypt by clicking on the key on the bottom right hand corner.</p>
<p>Additional security measures:</p>
<p>The number one way to circumvent this form of encryption is to create a third party intermediary between you and the other person (&#8220;man in the middle&#8221;). First they replace your public key with their public key and then decrypt it, then recrypt it using your correct public key and send it to the true recipient. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want your public key to be on many sites/in many places so that it can’t be replaced by someone else’s public key to get access to the communications. Use https websites.</li>
<li>You want to right click on a user’s key and select key properties, and read out the “<strong>fingerprint</strong>” (a summary of the key) in person to verify that you have the correct public key. If one byte is changed in the public key, it gives a different fingerprint.</li>
<li>What happens when private keys are compromised? “key revocation certificate” creates a centralized way to inform people not to use the public key.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use encryption to sign the email and even a recipient who does not have your public key will know it’s sent by you. That’s a separate feature.</p>
<p>Multiple keys, and transitioning to new keys: You should begin to transition to new keys in advance, and use it to sign emails that are encrypted using the old key. Then, when you revoke the old key, people know that the new key is from the same person.</p>

	<p>The Public School/Sudoroom are located in a community space that’s open to all. They hosted a series of short talks.</p>
<p><strong>Big Data</strong> talk, we no longer need to process data before storing it because the storage is so cheap, that’s a sea change – just store it all and figure it out later when the technology to process it is available. Loading and unloading can be the most limiting factor/it’s a bottleneck. SO you want that storage to be the analytic platform reducing loading and unloading. Microsegmentation becomes possible. Predictive analytics and machine learning is the new way to find insider trading because it’s so cutting edge. Data is never thrown away so they can always rerun the algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>DAC</strong> in Oakland, an organization hosted a walking tour. Economic reasons drove these decisions, we always should ask what is the economic result? Target is poor people and people of color, how does it impact those populations. More than just cameras &#8211; digital data as well, overlay maps with people watching the feeds. And shared with the Fusion centers. Voho mobile phone system to map surveillance via mms. Send photos to <a href="mailto:icu@vojo.co" target="_blank">icu@vojo.co</a> with %[address]. <a href="http://vojo.co/icu" target="_blank">http://vojo.co/icu</a></p>
<p><strong>East Bay Mesh</strong> (presented by Sudoroom’s Jenny &amp; colleague). Big local network of wifis talking together. Community owned infrastructure. Buy a wifi router and replace the operating system with theirs, install mesh protocol batman. Connection to internet is the complicated part. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N</a>. not Tor but uses something related. Relay nodes, exit notes, these hide your source IP so that you don’t become liable for mesh use of your internet. OpenWRT is the router operating system, Batman advanced protocol. Creating the 501(c)(3). Looking for volunteers, doing classes and workshops, you can help out on Thursday nights. Network is separate from the nonprofit, they’re helping support nodes, and then peering agreements for self-supported ones. Raised money for first 100 nodes (routers and antennas). Meshmap.sudoroom.org to map antennas. IRC: Freenode #510pen. How do we connect Oakland and SF? Internet connection to SF using dark fiber, they are talking to Internet Archive about doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Security Activism</strong> from Danny O’Brien, example is the cryptoparty earlier in the day. Security activism is what allows other forms of activism to exist &#8211; they all rely on privacy. Digital security politics: the history. They know everything and you know nothing. Digital security is personal, technological and political. They’re all interrelated. Danny is the international director. They’re using their experience from copyright to chart the progress of the surveillance debate. What can we do, hit above our weight, coalitions. Technological solutions. Personal feedback loops to show you have succeeded helped with copyright, and there’s no feedback from combatting surveillance. There are no visuals either. And the NSA is much worse as an enemy than the RIAA. We’re fighting for other people, so encryption isn’t helping them. NSA&#8217;s secrecy might be their downfall, we have the advantage of openness. Private ownership of data is important.</p>

<p><strong>August 4th Review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positives: speakers, Sina, Sam and EFF gets the credit. Videos, good sound system, whistles, sign table, positive relations with the police, anarchists were dissuaded.</li>
<li>older attendees &#8211; this issue came up in the 60s, great we got older people.</li>
<li>Lots of attendees ~400 &#8211; but we want more people.</li>
<li>traditional political activists do not feel there&#8217;s a strong connection to this issue. new activists came, who were able to relate to it. not life and death. show them scenarios why it matters &#8211; blackmail (expressed in the negative: spying is ok as long as you&#8217;ve never done anything wrong, you never will do anything wrong, and you love no-one). Cannibal cop in NY, actual abuse. UK politician, FBI agent book. Lots of details here. Value of rule of law to create a viceral response.</li>
<li>Lots of messages to be promoted at future events. Ads, media marketing. Make our message more concrete for bay area residents. Oakland, anarchist message. More flyers posted.</li>

Encryption Workshop. Typically very introductory. People bring their laptops. PGP, Redphone, encrypted text messages and phone calls.</li>
<li>Existing cryptoparties, we should collaborate with other groups. &#8220;Cryptoparty SF&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://cryptopartysf.org/" target="_blank">http://cryptopartysf.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Wes&#8217;s honeypot project: Identified situations where access to data is abused. 611 Folsom is still filtering data, what about trying to get flagged, we can see if they try to access it on our server. Human rights activists are monitored, opportunity to reach out based on this. License plate readers, FOIA request for cars used by gov officials, and then use the videos to track. Existing private network of videos can be used to track the cars. Honey pots? It&#8217;s hard to detect passive surveillance (tor was obvious) but detecting active attacks is easier. But active attacks prove passive surveillance. Isn&#8217;t this counterproductive &#8211; not exactly an abuse to pursue a potential terrorist. Do we want to prove something that was already proven?</li>
</ul>
<p>We are forming a working group for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness of abusers is they have to recruit intelligent people, nsa recruiting tactics. Computer science professors are asking their students not to work there.</li>
<li>Getting city councils to sign a nonbinding resolution. It&#8217;s easy for them to do it, raises visibility in local areas and reaches out to normal people. Recitation videos too. Alice and Michael are going to do SF. Combining this with town hall groups. Combining this with town hall groups. Blueprint needs to be created. Get a list of city councils and their history, focus on districts with reps who voted in favor of the Amash Amendment. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/</a> Data here <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing</a></li>
<li>Bob, street theater as fun outreach to individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meshnet</strong></p>
<p>Our meshnet person couldn’t be here, Alice is giving a vague overview. PM if you want to get in touch with him for <strong><em>thursdays at noisebridge</em></strong>. PM for IRC.</p>
<p>There are different levels of interest and involvement, I know some are put off by the high tech stuff, so I’ll separate it into three parts and then do questions. First, an overview all a meshnet does is encrypt between computers &#8211; no endpoint encryption/protection. Since everything is displayed on/typed into a computer without encryption, this depends on your computer itself being secure – we know windows has a keylogger for example. Three levels of interest are hardware-to-hardware meshnet (long term goal), internet based (hyberboria), and then layperson.</p>
<ul>
<li>First; the ideal is hardware-to-hardware. Our project meshnet contact needs people who can contribute hardware and who understand hardware. His current transmitter is .5 miles and he lives near filmore and geary. If you want to set up your own meshlocal, you can talk to him. He has outlined several other hardware-to-hardware options…</li>
</ul>
<p>o Two intro videos <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch" target="_blank">http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s</a></p>
<p>o We are using cjdns protocol for meshlocals in SF. cjdns=the software that runs on the nodes that are a part of hyperboria and/or meshnet. The batman protocol is being used in Oakland, sudoroom <strong><em>Thursdays</em></strong> to work on batman protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the meantime, if you just want to encrypt your communications, they are running cjdns over the internet. There’s an irc channel where you can get introduced to this. It’s called hyperboria. It is not ideal because it is not hardware to hardware but this is still a respectably secure way to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>o Both these methods make you a “node” which means it requires some processing power – but its not that bad. You can use hyperboria with your existing hardware.</p>
<p>o Currently only works with linux and mac, but they’re working on a windows version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third, if you cannot run linux or figure out how to use irc… if that’s beyond you, we still will be looking for financial contributions and other ways to promote meshet, in the coming months, so you can sign up to support meshnet without being a user yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why meshnet? We might not have a choice, it may be too late to restore the fourth, and in the meantime. &#8220;Meet people where they are, at their level, try to get them to engage one level higher.&#8221; &#8211; Alex</p>
<ul>
<li>Branding? Meshnet will be mentioned at cryptoparties. We will vote later on whether we support meshnet as an organization (preliminary vote seems positive) once they&#8217;ve looked into it further.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location, seems like powell is the most convenient, two people came by caltrain so being near caltrain isn&#8217;t that important. Seemed like it was diffcult for a few people to get here.</li>
<li>Making a website (Daniel and Thawab, with some involvement from Ryan).</li>
<li>Michael as acting Regional Coordinator for 30 days and then we can reopen the issue. Ayes have it.</li>
<li>Alan update on national, gives an overview of how it started. There&#8217;s an oversight committee, with local chapters represented with a low barrier to entry, event in last 90 days. Executives are elected. Mission of executive committee is being worked out. They want to buy restorethefourth.com.</li>
</ul>

	<p>PRESS STATEMENT</p>
<p>For immediate release</p>
<p><strong>Restore the Fourth SF Prepares for Second Major Rally on Sunday, August 4th</strong></p>
<p>Seeks to build on momentum of July 4th protests with prominent guest speakers, enhance awareness of constitutional abuses, and encourage citizen participation</p>
<p>Restore the Fourth — the grassroots, non-partisan, non-violent movement dedicated to ending all forms of unconstitutional surveillance of digital communications by the U.S. government — is preparing to hold its second major nationwide rally on Sunday, August 4th. The San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth will hold its rally at Justin Herman Plaza (at Market and Steuart) beginning at noon. Several prominent guest speakers, including whistleblowers Daniel Ellsberg and Mark Klein, will be in attendance.</p>
<p>This second rally follows the success of the July 4th, 2013 event, which saw tens of thousands of Americans turn out nationwide to raise awareness of unconstitutional surveillance, such as that employed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in its recently-revealed metadata collection and PRISM programs, and to encourage the cessation of all U.S. government surveillance that stands in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Approximately 400 people marched down Market Street in San Francisco on July 4th to voice their concerns over such issues. The event and guest speakers will aim to educate and increase awareness of the government’s spying initiatives and to encourage more Americans to take a stand in defense of their privacy. The rally will also address local elected representatives, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (of California’s 12th congressional district), focusing on those who have supported the NSA surveillance program.</p>
<p>During a recent vote in the House on an amendment that would have curbed the NSA’s spying powers championed by Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), for example, Congresswoman Pelosi voted against the amendment and for the unconstitutional NSA programs.</p>
<p>At the rally, participants will have the chance to express their individual concerns over privacy and government surveillance by adding Post-it notes to a public comment board. Following appearances by the guest speakers, the boards will be delivered to the San Francisco Federal Building, where Congresswoman Pelosi’s district office is.</p>
<p>“We are holding this event to reinforce our previous point: That this incursion onto our privacy affects everyone — whether they are aware of the issue or not — and that there are enough people outraged at the actions of the government that there is a loud public outcry,” said Ryan Brown, an organizer within the San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth. “We are here to show the people of San Francisco, our elected officials, and the nation at large that there are individuals out there who care about everyone&#8217;s right to privacy — and who are willing to fight for it.”</p>
<p>The San Francisco rally begins at 12pm in the Embarcadero Plaza. Guest speakers will be featured from 1-2pm. Among the speakers will be Daniel Ellsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers detailing controversial government secrets about the Vietnam War, and Mark Klein, the former AT&amp;T technician who revealed in 2006 that the company was colluding with the NSA by diverting customer data through NSA collection filters — including one located in AT&amp;T’s San Francisco office. Also present will be Norman Solomon, founder of the Institute for Public accuracy, which works to provide alternate information sources for journalists, and Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.</p>
<p>Expected turnout for the rally is about 400 people.</p>
<p>Restore the Fourth originated as a nationwide movement on social news website reddit.com in June 2013 in response to revelations of the U.S. government’s massive and unconstitutional surveillance programs. The organization has also established presences on Facebook (facebook.com/RestoreThe4thSF) and Twitter (twitter.com/RestoreThe4thSF); updates can be found on both sites.</p>

	<div>
<div>
<p><strong>  Part One: National Leadership; Over arching themes</strong></p>
<p>Principles:Non-violence and separation of our other political stances from this particular issue so we can spread this message and reach out across the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Goals</strong></p>
<p>Restoring hope to the people of the United States and helping them realize that they can change the course of the US government by coming out and supporting us in any manner they can.</p>
<p>AWARENESS is our current primary goal. Grow our Active base by spreading the word via social networking and informative videos about the fourth amendment and why it is important as well as eventually a video project. (Currently looking for people who are very familiar with editing software.)</p>
<p>Talking about the renewal date of Metadata tracking. Keeping the issue in the media (while remaining mindful of the media&#8217;s tendency toward vilifying our cause.)</p>
<p>Begin to use (or continue to use) Non-Prism search engines. (Possibly stop using facebook and other social networking sites as a form of protest at some point.)</p>
<p>Read up on our oppositions arguments and prepare counters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Events each must provide net gain on momentum, or achieve something concrete.</li>
<li>Hope, a chance to participate in government. Use fun events.</li>
<li>Explicit exclusion of any partisan issue even one that individuals might associate with the 4th amendment.</li>
<li>What does it mean to fight an institutional consensus?</li>
<li>The bill of rights isn&#8217;t a list of laws, it&#8217;s a list of facts &#8211; of what the limits of a sustainable government are.</li>
<li>Agenda plus Alternative = change. We have an agenda, let&#8217;s develop an alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part Three: Actions</strong></p>
<p>1-5 scale on civil disobedience. Examples of success: PETA, montreal student movement 2012, civil rights movement (distinction of tangible issues). Abstraction? Civil rights can be tangible, even the 4th. Digital civil disobedience. After a vote, 23/25 agree: <strong>This group has generally agreed that we are not planning on using civil disobedience at this time.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Cryptoparties, noisebridge as a location. in the mean time, a summary (Eric and Alan).</li>
<li>Action: Organizing town hall type meetings in all Bay Area cities and counties. (We currently have ones in Santa Rosa and San Francisco in the works)</li>
<li>Action: Videotaping project involves getting citizens, public figures and teachers to recite the fourth amendment on camera and then stating what the amendment means to them. (We eventually plan on editing all of these together to form a longer; yet still short documentary about the movement and the fourth amendment.) Youtube channel created.</li>
<li>Action: 8/4 2pm speakers at embarcadero, handing out flyers throughout market 11-2 (dressed up as NSA). Recordings? &#8220;Proposed&#8221; to be discussed on reddit, facebook. Preference for elected officials on embarcadero. government employees. Video</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Count the federal criminal laws?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pressuring companies not to backdoor, alternative to direct government action? Boycotts? Pressuring employees? Thawab points out: targeting private companies may be too difficult because money drives that industry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feinstein &#8211; for people who specifically want to approach the blight that is Feinstein, you have a massive resource in David Levitt. Contact him if you want to do anything related to that. <a href="http://www.levitt2012.org/" target="_blank">http://www.levitt2012.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Roles created: Video and Youtube team, Cryptoparty team, Town Hall teams, Feinstein specialist. Assigned responsibilities to the people who come to me with ideas or questions or skills.</p>
