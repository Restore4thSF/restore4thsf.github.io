<p><strong>Daniel Roesler</strong></p>
<p>We started handing out badge ribbons this morning at around 7:20am. I picked a spot on the sidewalk just to the south of the keynote entrance (which began at 8am). I had handed out about 100 ribbons in 15 minutes before the building security came out and said that the sidewalk was private property and I needed to go down to the corner.</p>
<p>So, I moved down to the corner of 4th and Howard to join Zaki. We handed out about 400 ribbons until around 8:15am, when another building security guy came up and said that they had permits for that block. I needed to go to work at that point anyway, so we packed up and left.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;d say that it was a big success this morning. Zaki and I were wearing suits so we were well received by the attendees walking by. There was one guy who said he worked for the RSA and that that is not what happened and I should be ashamed of myself. I asked for him to give an interview so he could explain more, but he stormed off. Another few people took a small stack of ribbons so they could hand them out inside.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell Colbert</strong><br />
I had a radically different experience thankfully. I stayed up at Yerba Buena Garden and approached people on their way to or from lunch. I had no run ins with security and gave out over a hundred ribbons in about an hour and a half. I encountered a lot of push backs, many people didn&#8217;t even bother to stop but some were real supporters. Only one was very pro-NSA, when I explained what RSA did for the NSA her response was something to the effect of &#8216;yay for patriots, I feel safer.&#8217; I&#8217;ve done enough canvassing to know not to engage people like that.</p>
<p>I had three notable positive interactions. One with a gentleman from Booz Allen Hamilton who wholeheartedly supported the cause but felt he would be risking his job to display a ribbon on his badge. A gentleman from Forrester Research said something very similar but took two ribbons and tweeted a photo on the spot. Another guy mentioned having already given a pro-4th Amendment speech and hoping to do more. I wanted to try to recruit people into future actions but I didn&#8217;t know what actions or how to go about it. I should have at least gotten business cards.</p>
<p>I had many more good conversations about the RSA&#8217;s complacency with the NSA, more than I can list. I had the opposite experience with ribbons too, for me everyone wanted to Support the 4th, rather than RSA Selling Them Out. I did end up coming across two RSA employees. One asked me if I knew the whole story or if I was just told to hand out ribbons. I responded that I knew as much as any member of the public could hope as I have read a lot on the matter. He said there was more to it and I inquired as to what but he refused to answer saying that there was too much to explain. I encouraged him and the RSA to find time to explain and wished him a good day.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Gonzales</strong></p>
<p>I was doing very well near the conference building entrance, especially when Code Pink revealed their banner but was asked to move on to the corner sidewalk at 5th street.  Security officer said that was a public sidewalk but everywhere else was for RSA.  He was a nice about it so I didn’t challenge him.  But another security officer was keeping eye out on us on 5th street.  I notice the Europeans were more concern about the NSA/RSA than their US counterparts.</p>

	<p>Tuesday, Feb 25 2013-Today, RSA opened their annual security security and Restore the Fourth SF was there to protest.  RSA&#8217;s history of bad actions are beyond the pale and could not go unanswered.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2004, RSA selected an elliptic curve random number generator called DUAL_EC_DRBG as the default in their products.</li>
<li>In 2007, two Microsoft Researchers discovered that DUAL_EC_DRBG has predictable output known only to the designer of the algorithm. This would world permit the NSA to discover secret cryptographic keys generated by this random number generator.</li>
<li>In September 2013, the revelations about mass NSA surveillance made the situation with DUAL_EC_DRBG untenable and RSA changed their guidance to customers.</li>
<li>In December 2013, Reuters obtained the original contract between RSA and the NSA that specified the selection of DUAL_EC_DRBG and a payment of $10 million dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">These questions are a matter of public record. The fundamental question ignorant of the state of the art in cryptography research and thus grossly negligent or were the co conspirators with the NSA?</span></p>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Was RSA aware of patent US2007189527 that discloses the backdoor in DUAL_EC_DRBG?</li>
<li>Was RSA aware of publication of the backdoor by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson from Microsoft?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>The most profound consequence of RSA complicity is that there is circumstantial evidence that this is not an isolated incident. DUAL_EC_DRBG is a part of an NSA program called BULLRUN with an annual budget of $250 million.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Restore the Fourth SF took the annual RSA conference as opportunity to prompt discussion among the attendees of government backdoors and their impact on trustworthiness of the American technology. We handed out badge ribbons with the message &#8220;I Support the 4th&#8221; or &#8220;RSA Sold Us Out&#8221;. The latter was far more popular. Restore the Fourth SF volunteers took up positions on the sidewalks to hand out the ribbons. We had some negative encounters with RSA security staff but eventually SFPD accepted that we have free speech rights on public side walks. We distributed approx 1500 badge ribbons to attendees. We were able to educate many people who where unaware of NSA bad practices.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, February 25th, 2014, I biked down to Moscone Center in San Francisco to participate in a small action to protest RSA’s taking of $10 million from the NSA to weaken security in their own product. There was an RSA conference in the center at the time. I stood on the sidewalk, and handed out badge ribbons to attendees. “Did you know RSA took $10 million from the NSA? We’ve got stickers for your badges.” A few people were dismissive, many ignored us or said no, but quite a few took the stickers (we handed out almost 2000 in one day). Some people asked for more to give out at sessions they were going to.</p>
<p>We had two types of ribbons. One said “RSA sold us out” and the other said “I support the 4th” (as in Amendment to the Constitution). I would have thought that the first, being a more aggressive message, would be less popular, but no, actually it was more popular! Perhaps this is because of the large number of foreigners at the conference &#8211; Europeans seem particularly riled up about NSA spying &#8211; with whom talk of the US Constitution doesn’t resonate.</p>
<p>I was warned by others that the conference staff wouldn’t “let” us hand them out on the sidewalk right outside Moscone center. I decided I would do it anyway, and for a long time was not harassed by any conference staff. I moved around a bit, though, around the different corners of 4th St and Howard, trying to find which one had the best flow of foot traffic.</p>
<p>At some point, when I was standing on the corner right outside Moscone Center (the west corner of the intersection of 4th and Howard), a staff member did tell me to stop, and I said I wouldn’t. He said he would get the cop from inside, and I told him to go ahead.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Officer Shavers SFPD 38 being a right sick. Saying I can&#39;t stand on the corner of Howard and 4th outside Moscone and hand out stickers.</p>
<p>&mdash; Martin MacKerel (@kemokid) <a href="https://twitter.com/kemokid/statuses/438420099733520384">February 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Soon a cop who reminded me strongly of the character of “Doakes” from the show “Dexter” appeared. He was immediately incredibly belligerent, getting right in my personal space and refusing to answer my questions. When I said that the sidewalk was public, not private, property, he said that it was city property and that the conference had a permit for the sidewalk as well as the conference center itself. When I objected that there was no bronze placard in the sidewalk or other overt indication that it was not public property, he just told me to move across the street. When I asked, he identified himself as Officer Shavers, badge number 38 (SFPD). I asked to see the permit, and he refused. He said he would arrest me if staff asked for a CA (a citizen’s arrest), and then immediately turned to the staff member standing a few feet away and asked him if he wanted to make a citizen’s arrest. I was pissed off that he wouldn’t engage me in conversation about this, and asked if he would walk with me across the street to talk about the situation. He wouldn&#8217;t, and told me again to cross the street to the south corner. At that point I said I would cross when the light changed, and I did.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Won&#39;t show me a permit either.</p>
<p>&mdash; Martin MacKerel (@kemokid) <a href="https://twitter.com/kemokid/statuses/438420154951561216">February 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Rather than being a neutral arbiter of the law and of the permitting situation, he was clearly siding with the staff and trying to get me to leave without listening to me. I should emphasize that I was engaged in the mildest of First Amendment activity &#8211; talking to one or a handful of people at a time and passing out material. I didn’t have a bullhorn, nor was I engaging people for more than a few seconds if they were not interested.</p>
<p>Later I crossed over to the east corner of the intersection &#8211; kitty-corner from where the officer had confronted me. To my surprise, he came up to me and resumed his belligerent and threatening behaviour. When I expressed incredulity that even that corner was covered by the permit, he told me that if I wanted to be on that block that I had to cross to the east side of 3rd St (a full block away). The only option nearby, it seemed, was the south corner of 4th and Howard by the Oasis Grill. I asked again to see the permit. He told me that he knew the permit was valid and good, and I didn’t need to see it. He brought his handcuffs out from his belt and flashed them menacingly at me. I retreated to the south corner, but first I asked to talk with his supervisor. He said his commanding officer was Sergeant Miller, and that he would come by.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, he crossed to the south corner and said “you asked me to speak with you?” and I said, “well, yes, I did when we first talked, on the west corner”. I said I wanted to wait to speak with the sergeant.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, a couple more cops showed up on the west corner. They were soon all in discussion with conference staff, and were poring over some papers &#8211; presumably the permit. I waited about 15 minutes for the sergeant to come over and talk to me, but he never did. Eventually, I walked over and DM came with me to record the interaction. Sergeant Miller had a very reasonable tone of voice, and said that the staff had been confused, and that we were allowed to be on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>He didn’t apologize, but I was okay with the outcome. I decided not to make a fuss about Officer Shavers’s behaviour, and walked across to the north corner to resume handing out badge ribbons.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Sergeant Miller showed up. Said the conference staff were confused. Said we had the right to be on the sidewalk. Thought so.</p>
<p>&mdash; Martin MacKerel (@kemokid) <a href="https://twitter.com/kemokid/statuses/438433432033427456">February 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I was going to leave it at that &#8211; it seemed like an honest (if aggressive and bull-headed) mistake on the part of the original officer.</p>
<p>But later I found out that during a separate action earlier in the day, both Shavers and Sergeant Miller had been on the scene when another “confusion” about the permit occurred. You can see Miller (gray-haired buzz cut) and conference staff looking over the permit here:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ari/12803154953/player/cb953040e9" height="212" width="320"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This to me raises this incident from a one-off mistake to an abuse of power. The staff had already conveniently over-interpreted their permit, and the police had already looked over the permit. Shavers abused his power as a police officer to bully me off the corner with credible threats of arrest, despite the fact that I had every right to be on the sidewalk, which is public property. Moreover, the conference staff used this on-duty police officer to push away free speech that they didn’t like.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I will pursue some kind of recourse or official complaint against the behaviour of the SFPD in this case. But I am considering it.</p>
<p>And my opinion of RSA has actually been lowered. No mean feat. I don’t expect them to embrace criticism, but to use the police to squelch basic First Amendment rights &#8211; that’s beyond the pale.</p>

<p><i>Shining A Light on the NSA: Outdoor Projection at Room 641A, NSA Interception Site at 611 Folsom Street</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>San Francisco-On Tuesday February 11th at 6:00pm, Bay Area residents will join people all over the world outraged by revelations about National Security Agency and private corporations blanket electronic surveillance in <a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/" target="_blank">The Day We Fight Back</a>, a national online protest.</p>
<div>
<p>The San Francisco event will be at AT&amp;T, 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco. The AT&amp;T building houses an NSA interception room in Room 641A.</p>

<p>In January 2012 , proposed SOPA and PIPA censorship legislation was met with the largest Internet protest in history. A year ago this month one of that movement&#8217;s leaders, Aaron Swartz, tragically passed away. Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet, and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society: mass surveillance. If Aaron were alive, he&#8217;d be on the front lines, fighting against a world in which governments observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action. Now, on the anniversary of Aaron&#8217;s passing, and in celebration of the win against SOPA and PIPA that he helped make possible, there is a new day of protest.</p>

				</h2>

	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>

	<div class="post-content-content">

	<p>Resolved:</p>
<p>A group of concerned Apple shareholders proposes several technical and policy actions Apple should take immediately, without waiting to be compelled by shareholders, to quickly earn back user trust and demonstrate Apple’s competence in repelling modern threats to user privacy.</p>
<p>We ask that the board enact a policy to use technical methods and other best practices to protect user data. Such best practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption: Implement encryption techniques such as Forward Secrecy and the other recommended best practices cited in the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s recent reports on encryption.</li>
<li>SSL Key Revocation: Revoke and update SSL encryption keys and any similar digital  entities that may have been compromised, immediately and as often as necessary for the security of user data.</li>
<li>Secure Network Equipment: Remove or replace any equipment that may be used for unconstitutional bulk surveillance at sites managed by Apple, to every legally permissible extent. Third-party equipment, such as interception devices installed in compliance with &#8220;pen trap and trace&#8221; orders, should provide access to confirm the devices can not be used for unconstitutional bulk collection or over-collection of data. If any court order or warrant must be withdrawn or revised to achieve this, Apple may seek relief from the courts – such as FISC courts that have already discovered systematic over-collection of data and ruled some programs unconstitutional – in the course of legally removing such equipment.</li>
<li>Transparency: Expand deployment of measures such as the “warrant canary” and “dead man switch” so users can be confident that Apple networks and encryption keys have not been compromised – or can be alerted if they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, as a U.S. company Apple has constitutional and ethical duties that include respecting the 4th Amendment.</p>
<p>Apple should, to the full extent permissible by law, deploy its strengths in both technology and law to publicly reveal, challenge, reduce, and overturn every government attempt at covert surveillance against its customers that doesn&#8217;t meet these standards: surveillance of single, identified individuals under a warrant issued by a neutral judge, particularly describing the person and places to be searched, and of limited duration. To the full extent permissible by law, Apple should not actively or passively agree to do or allow covert mass surveillance against its customers, nor remain silent about what Apple and the government have done or are doing.</p>
<p>Lost trust will not be regained until Apple users and shareholders understand whether Apple is a paid participant in unconstitutional bulk surveillance, a hapless victim of it, a gagged hostage of government spies, badly in need of help – or, whether Apple is truly an effective foe of such surveillance.</p>
<p>For stewards of user data like Apple, both ethical standards and user trust are essential to sustaining shareholder value. Failing to acknowledge and address these realities can cause the company serious ongoing financial harm, particularly in international markets. Conversely, by addressing these issues forthrightly Apple can win back the trust of customers, provide leadership, offer competitive advantages, and strengthen the entire industry.</p>
